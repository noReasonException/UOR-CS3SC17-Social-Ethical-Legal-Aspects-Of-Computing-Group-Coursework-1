**Key Issues**

**Key Issue 1** – Can we definitely distinguish between real humans and artificially engineered replicants. If no test (neither objective or subjectively introspective) can show this for certain – then is a given replicant that is indistinguishable from a human therefore a human?

**Key Issue 2** – Memories and how, from a dramatic philosophy point, they cannot be trusted. As humans we tend to treat our memories as reasonably accurate accounts of past events but the film introduces the idea that memories can and may be implanted – therefore false or misleading.

**Key Issue 3** – What would I take to fundamentally question your memoires and consider that they may be implanted because of a drug or mental conditioning.

**Key Issue 4** – In the director&#39;s cut of the film, Rachael is revealed to have a life longer than the 4 years of the Nexus-6 replicants however it&#39;s unclear if it is similar or beyond that of a human. Therefore, is the scenario of escape at the close of the film therefore no longer a happy ever after?

**Key Issue 5** – In the director&#39;s cut of the film, there is the question as to if Deckard is a replicant. In that scenario what is the impact of his feelings for Rachael?

**Key Issue 6** – Was it wrong to enslave the replicants, using them as forced labour given that they were of human-like appearance and had human-like thought process. What would need to be different to be ok to be used as slave labour – e.g. would we have the same doubts with mechanised robotic droids with limited thought process and emotions?

**Key Issue 7** – If humans want replicants/androids to obey rules of human society, e.g. laws, should they be afforded the same right rights as humans. See self-driving cars – they are expected to follow human laws but are not considered living, let alone human, but they do not have physical or mental feelings like replicants.

**Key Issue 8** – Would different groups such as vegan/vegetarians see replicants/androids differently to people who eat meat. What about religion, would someone who believes in a god, gods or has other spiritual beliefs.

**Key Issue 9** – Tyrell Corporation is a monopoly in design and manufacture of replicants. Replicants are still technically considered robotic despite being organic, real life comparison can be drawn to our mechanical robots, except they are far more advanced.

**Key Issue 10** – When a replicant kills someone it is considered murder. (under UK law only a human can commit murder, therefore replicants would be considered human under current UK law, and therefore their enslavement would also be illegal. See issue 6/7)

**Key Issue 11** – Replicants are considered lower class. Disposable – think bomb disposal robot, combat drones. Pleasure replicants (Prostitute robots (are human prostitutes today considered lower class?)).

Replicants in the film are firmly presented as being lower class, they are used as slaves and have virtually no rights, particularly on Earth where they are totally forbidden and are to be &quot;retired&quot; as soon as they arrive considering they are trespassing. They have no option to decide their own career and are produced to serve a single role. It is shown in the film that replicants can be &quot;retrained&quot;, as Zhora was &quot;bred for a special kick murder squad. Retrained for political homicide.&quot;. Though it is not mentioned what this involves, it could be some sort of education in the traditional sense, taking advantage of the powerful intellects of the replicants or more akin to brainwashing, forced to forget/unlearn one set of skills, and having another set of skills embedded into them. This could be achieved through modifying their memories. Some replicants, such as Pris, are designed to fill the role of &quot;pleasure&quot; for humans and potentially for replicants.

Relating to real life, artificial constructs such as machines, robots and artificial intelligences are almost certainly created to fill a specific role.

Washing machines provide a far more efficient method of washing clothes, a job that would take up to 15 hours for the whole process, which may have been done several times a week, before the advent of the automatic washing machines and dryers, a technology which is still developing to accommodate faster washing, more clothing materials and in a more energy efficient, environmentally friendly, compact design.

More advanced machines designed for more complex tasks are called robots, generally a machine is considered a robot if it is multipurpose, reprogrammable, has a high level of physical capability and high degree of automation or automatic functionality.

Robots today often fill roles such as:

High-risk bomb disposal, as human life is considered far more valuable than that of the machine. Bomb disposal robots are remotely controlled by a human (or team of human) operators assisted by the computer systems on board. The robot is not considered alive, so it is not as bad from an ethical perspective if something goes wrong and it is blown up.

Filling the role of factory assembly line workers, articulated industrial Robots can work faster for longer at a greater level of precision than their human counterparts. Work that includes consistent, predictable actions to build a well-documented item. For example, the welding of certain areas of a metal sheet, where a system of coordinates can be used to determine where welding should begin and end. Society does not consider these to be alive either, since they have no emotions, no capacity to think critically or deliberately, willingly, stray from their intended purpose. These robots do not have any rights or protections under the law, only their usage as industrial workplace equipment, they can work as long as they are able to, there is no 9-to-5 work schedule or Unions or labour laws. They can work until they are destroyed, something it would be considered, a moral abuse to do in today&#39;s world.

As Pris is a &quot;pleasure model&quot; in the film, there exists attempts to create real life &quot;sexbots&quot; by giving sex dolls the ability to speak, make facial expressions, move their bodies and exhibit human like responses to sexual activity.
