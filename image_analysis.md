## **Image Analysis (Surveillance and Facial Recognition)**

From one scene Esper &quot;Enhance&quot;, we have a number of possible parallels to 21st century privacy and related concerns. The scene in question features Blade Runner – Rick Deckard deciding to examine more closely a photograph confiscated from a replicants (Leon) hotel room. As well as examining by eye, he places the photograph into an Esper machine which performs further analysis. The Blade Runner press kit from the 1982 release describes an Esper as &quot;A high-density computer with very powerful three-dimensional resolution capacity. The police cars and Deckard&#39;s apartment contain small models which can be channelled into the large one at police headquarters&quot; [1].

This scene brings about questions around modern day technology such as CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) or other image capture, and how pervasive this is. The fact that the movie shows access from a home and mobile device indicates that such analysis is freely available.

In today&#39;s society with 4-5.9 million CCTV cameras in the UK - 2015 estimate by BSIA (British Security Industry Association) [2] we are subject to being observed and recorded in many populated areas, whilst proponents say that crime is reduced, others argue that it is mass surveillance.

&quot;The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the [Boston Marathon bombing](https://www.ifsecglobal.com/video-surveillance/london-2012-boston-marathon-securing-large-scale-events/) after sifting through video images captured by the city&#39;s cameras.

The Boston bombers were apprehended quickly due to surveillance cameras. While there is no dispute over how well the public cameras worked on that day, many lingering questions remain and will continue to drive debate for the foreseeable future.&quot; [3]

Later in the film. Deckard reviews a recording of an apartment he investigated earlier. The data is shown on his personal television and controlled by voice. Critically, it seems that there is no access controls for the data (the recording) – Deckard has not been required to demonstrate why he needs such access, which is being made from a non-secure location. The footage that is enhanced, is then printed, which makes sense in the plot of the film, but again raises various concerns.

Overall, we see a focus on the investigation with little regard to the confidentiality of data (in this case CCTV type footage). In the context of the film, where Decker is ostensibly &quot;chasing the bad guys&quot; this is easy to overlook. However, the ease at which data is accessed and the enhance feature poses questions for us in the real 2020, with a prevalent CCTV culture and suitably advanced facial recognition systems.

Legally, the UK in 2020 covers the data captured by CCTV and other forms of surveillance cameras as data, under the Data Protection Act / GDPR. However, specific covert surveillance activities of public authorities are not covered but rather they are governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Version 1.2 8 20170609 Powers Act (RIPA) 2000 and Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act (RIPSA) 2000. Critically this type of recording is covert and directed at an individual or individuals – so does not cover &quot;mass surveillance&quot;.

Generally, we have become a more voyeuristic society, not only with CCTV, but reality television, social media as well. We are now used to our imagery being captured and published on a macro scale, but there are key differences. As an individual we decide to partake in a reality television show, we generally agree to share via social media (agreement in the wider context, by joining the site).

From a social aspect, CCTV is typically regarded as a positive, a deterrent reducing anti-social behaviour and generally making people feel safer. &quot;The summer of 2011 riots undoubtedly strengthened public opinion towards CCTV. In one post-riots survey of two thousand adults, three quarters of respondents said they &#39;felt safer&#39; in public areas knowing CCTV was in operation, two thirds wanted to see more CCTV in their area, and seven out of 10 would be &#39;worried&#39; if their local council reduced CCTV coverage. 94 per cent of those surveyed backed the police using CCTV footage to identify those involved in the riots.&quot; [4]

The evidence for success is less compelling, of 4000 images subjected to facial recognition after the summer 2011 riots, only one arrest was made. [5]. Whereas in Airdrie, in the 2 years following installation of cameras a reduction in offences of 48% occurred, with little evidence of the crime simply moving &quot;out of sight&quot;. [6], in Glasgow, in the year following installation of cameras saw slight reductions, but an overall increase of crime by 9% [7] and in Birmingham, theft from persons was reduced, but theft from vehicles increased after installation of cameras in the early 1990s. [8].

More positive &amp; negative summary needed

Who has access is an interesting item, police and security services can request and access footage from other operators and in an investigative capacity (tracing a suspects movements whilst investigating a prior crime, or indeed acting on intelligence and aiming to prevent a crime) this would be almost universally acceptable. However, we must ask where is the boundary, with advances in Facial Recognition – does an expert operator need to be the one that follows the movements, or can a computer do this? If we accept that a computer can follow the suspect and report on their movements reliably – we now have an ethical problem - Should we use automated image capture and facial recognition to inform and attempt to prevent crime? Especially as the computer can cheaply scale to put ever increasing numbers of citizens under surveillance.

Access to a wide range of images is key to the success of an investigation such as that portrayed in the film. As we have mentioned previously, this does not seem to require authorisation – and the fact that the images are &quot;enhanced&quot; gives rise to a concern that the enhancement is changing the recorded fact. In the film, this is not the case – but recent developments in plenoptic cameras which can collect sufficient light data to recreate 3D models of suspects and even adjust the viewing angle of a picture after it has been taken means that we have the situation where technology may &quot;enhance&quot; evidence to the point that it is altered.

In other scenes, Deckard has access to information about the subjects he is pursuing. The intimation here is that there is a database of individuals readily accessible and used without constraint. When you consider the array of data known by various government agencies about you as an individual, it is not difficult to imagine this being combined into a very revealing consolidated database. Whilst researching this, we found that there are clear boundaries and the various agencies act within the confines of the Data Protection Act.

However, a prior case exists where the UK government has misused data, albeit in a pre-computing era. In 1939 a national identity card scheme was introduced by the National Registration Act for the purpose of security, national service and rationing. By 1950 the same cards were being used by 39 government agencies for reasons as diverse as collecting parcels from the post office to routine police enquiries. While any or even all of these were arguably justified, few could be justified under the terms of the initial Act. It was a combination of protest and the eventual recognition of this extension of use which led to the abolition of the Act that same year. [xx]

The issue here is the extension of technology employed for one reason, into repeated and regular use in another area which may not have been subjected to the appropriate scrutiny.

Well controlled, audited and managed data should pose no threat to the individual. The Data Protection Act enshrines this in law, and on the assumption that the CCTV operating entities follow the legislation there is little to fear. However, we should take the case where facial recognition could be used to build a &quot;network&quot; of contact for a person-of-interest. With so many sources of data for photographs available (DVLA for driving licences, Passport Office, Social Media as well as specific images from criminal records and targeted investigations) there is a risk of technology categorising a person incorrectly.

Person A meets person B in the street and they have a brief conversation, person B then meets person C a suspected terrorist. Should we tag person A as being of interest, a potential threat? Should we record the interaction in a database, later to be cross referenced without the context of the interaction? That would be particularly scary if one of us was person A, and we&#39;d been asked for directions by unknown person C!
