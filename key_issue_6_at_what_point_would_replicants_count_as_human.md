**Key Issue 6 - At what point would replicants count as human**

 Was it wrong to enslave the replicants, using them as forced labour given that they were of human-like appearance and had human-like thought process. What would need to be different to be ok to be used as slave labour â€“ e.g. would we have the same doubts with mechanised robotic droids with limited thought process and emotions?
