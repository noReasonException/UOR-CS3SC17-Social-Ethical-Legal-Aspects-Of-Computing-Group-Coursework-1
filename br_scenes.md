Scene 9 – Deckard investigates Leon&#39;s apartment with Gaff, he finds a photograph and a small fish scale like object. Gaff leaves an origami man with an erect penis, showing Deckard&#39;s mind is not entirely focused on the job at hand, but also on Rachael.

Scene 10 – Leon and Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants invade the icy workshop of the man who manufactures the eyes of the Nexus 6 replicants who tells them of JF Sebastian, genetic designer for Tyrell, after they break his warm clothing open.

Scene 12 – Pris infiltrates JF Sebastian&#39;s home by posing as lost/ a stray. Sebastian feels sorry for her and invites her in.

Scene 13 – Deckard places the photo he took from Leon&#39;s apartment into his Esper computer. This computer turns the small 2d photo into explorable 3d environment of the apartment he investigated. He controls his tv/computer by voice and uses it to move and enhance an image on his screen. He prints an image of Zhora from the enhanced footage onto a polaroid print paper hard copy.

Scene 14 – Deckard takes the scale to an elderly woman who identifies it through a microscope like computer system and identifies it as snake scale, not fish scale. She reads manufacturing information off it. Animals are often synthetic/created like replicants.

Scene 15 – Deckard intimidates the synthetic snake salesman for information on Zhora

Scene 16 – Deckard enters an early 20th century style bar. He interacts with the bars owner before video calling Rachael from a phone booth. No mobile phones. Zhora is employed here as a dancer.

Scene 17 – Deckard pretends to be an ethics and moral abuses reporter to gain access to Zhora&#39;s changing room. She eventually attacks him after making him lower his guard by acting seductively after she figures out the ruse. Zhora is unable to finish killing him because other dancers enter the room. Deckard pursues her.

Scene 18 – Deckard chases Zhora through busy streets. The population seem largely disinterested and more interested in their own happenings. Slow moving trams and large crowds. Deckard shoots Zhora which eventually draws the attention of the crowds. He identifies himself to police officers which drops their interest in him, since he is doing his job.

Scene 19 – Deckard is congratulated by Captain Bryant who mistakenly says there is 1 more to go when Deckard corrects him that there is 3 more. Leon attacks Deckard who almost is killed by having his eyes gouged but Rachael shoots Leon with Deckard&#39;s gun killing him.

Scene 20 – Deckard and Rachael discuss their first kill and the &quot;shakes&quot;. She asks Deckard if he would hunt her down to which he responds no but that someone would. He denies looking at her files since its classified. Rachael asks if Deckard has taken the V-K test but he is asleep. Rachael looks at his photos, replicants commonly use photos to build upon/connect implanted memories which triggers her to try to play the piano, which she can. Deckard awakens because of this; Rachael explains herself and the two begin a romance.

Scene 21 - Pris awakens in the home of Sebastian. She attempts to befriend him further and Roy arrives. Roy is asked to demonstrate his nexus 6 abilities to which he responds that they are physical and not computers. Pris says &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; before demonstrating her extreme agility and takes a egg out of boiling water to demonstrate their resilience. Roy informs Sebastian that they are running out of lifespan, eventually manipulating him into taking them to Tyrell. There is a chess board, where Sebastian and Tyrell play remotely, giving each party a great deal of time to think about their next move.

Scene 22 – Tyrell is in bed when Sebastian&#39;s arrival is announced. Roy quietly gives a chess move to Sebastian who repeats it. Tyrell makes a move before Roy counters it, winning the game. Tyrell, intrigued invites Sebastian up to his room. He very quickly recognises Roy as a replicant and asks what he wants. Roy asks how to extend his lifespan to which Tyrell states he cannot, once made they are finished due to the human-based physiology, the two go back and forth on the science behind life extension before Tyrell declares it&#39;s impossible: &quot;a light that burns twice as bright burns half as long&quot;. Roy calls Tyrell his father before killing him with by crushing his skull. Roy then turns to Sebastian.

Scene 23 – Bryant reports to Deckard over the car&#39;s communication system/ &quot;radio&quot;. Sebastian&#39;s death is reported so Deckard investigates the apartment by posing as a friend of Sebastian&#39;s to gain entry.

Scene 24 – As Deckard investigates the house filled with part-organic part-toy creations, Pris disguises herself as one before ambushing Deckard. Pris uses her superior speed, agility, and strength to gain the upper hand but in a moment of overconfidence Deckard shoots her. She writhes around in pain loudly before Deckard fires at her more killing her.

Scene 25 – Roy arrives as the house to find Pris dead. He kisses her before investigating the house for her killer. Deckard lies in wait and fires a shot at Roy who quickly avoids the bullet due to his abilities. Roy taunts Deckard for firing on an unarmed man (is someone capable of easily killing with their bare hands truly unarmed?) saying he is supposed to be the &quot;good man&quot;. As Deckard stalks the building Roy smashes his hand through a wall and grabs Deckard&#39;s hand with his gun in it. Roy breaks some of his fingers for his fallen friends before letting Deckard take back his hand, and gun, and giving him a free shot at Roy&#39;s head through the wall. Roy manages to mostly dodge but the top of his ear/side of his head is grazed, perhaps a result of either limitations to his speed naturally or because of his bodies dying nature. Deckard attempts to escape the house but loses his gun while climbing. Eventually he is cornered by Roy. Deckard strikes at him with a pipe. Roy calls his actions illogical and unsportsmanlike. Deckard attempts to escape again. Roy drives a nail through his hand creating a stigmata. He follows Deckard. Deckard attempts to leap to another building but fails, clinging onto an overhang with risk of falling to his death. Roy attempts the same jump and lands gracefully, once again demonstrating the superior abilities of the Nexus 6. Batty muses about what it is to be a slave. Instead of allowing Deckard to die, even after Deckard spits at him, Roy saves him, dragging him up to the roof, before his body shuts down. His mind and body deteriorating in this final encounter.

His final action can be interpreted in multiple ways; either he wants his final action be considered a &quot;good&quot; one, or that by killing Deckard, no one will be left alive who experienced Roy&#39;s story first hand and that to be remembered was all he really wanted in the end. Perhaps Roy began to develop emotional capabilities like a true human in his final moments.

Gaff appears to give Deckard back his gun. He leaves by saying &quot;It&#39;s too bad she won&#39;t live, but then again, who does?&quot; referring to Rachael.

Scene 26 – Deckard goes back to his apartment to collect Rachael, before they enter the elevator to run away together Deckard finds an origami unicorn, to which he recalls Gaff&#39;s words.
