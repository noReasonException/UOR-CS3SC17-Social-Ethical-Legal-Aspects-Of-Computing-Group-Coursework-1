**Key Issue 7 - Replicants and Human laws**

If humans want replicants/androids to obey rules of human society, e.g. laws, should they be afforded the same right rights as humans. See self-driving cars â€“ they are expected to follow human laws but are not considered living, let alone human, but they do not have physical or mental feelings like replicants.
