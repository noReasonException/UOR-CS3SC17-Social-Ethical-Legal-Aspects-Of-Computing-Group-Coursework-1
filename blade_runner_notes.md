Blade Runner is a 1982 film based on the science fiction novel &quot;Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; authored by Philip K. Dick. The film is set in the near future of 2020 (near-future at the time of release).

The core plot of the movie involves a semi-retired law enforcement official (Dekard) being given a special mission – to eliminate a group of rogue replicants. Replicants are genetically engineered human-like creatures designed to live only a few years. Enslaved, the replicants are used a labour of other planets. This group have rebelled and escaped back to earth seeking to increase their lifespan, and Deckard is required to kill them all, which he does all but one – falling in love and sheltering the replicant Rachel.

The movie brings to the fore some troubling questions around AI and cloning, forcing us to answer the question – what does it mean to be human? If it looks human, acts human, but we made it, then can we kill it like one would kill a process or scrap a vehicle?

Key issue – can we definitely distinguish between real humans and artificially engineered replicants. If no test, neither objective if subjectively introspective) can show this for sure – then is a given replicant that is indistinguishable from a human therefore human?

Key issue – memories and how from a dramatic philosophical point, they cannot be trusted. As humans we tend to treat our memories as reasonably accurate accounts of past events – but the moving introduces the idea that the memories may be implanted – therefore false or misleading.

Key issue – What would it take to fundamentally question your memoires and consider that they may be implanted as a result of a drug or mental condition?

Key issue – the directors cut of the movie makes clear that Rachel has a short replicant life-span not a full human length one. Is the scenario of escape therefore no longer a happy ever after?

Key issue – again in the directors cut of the movie, there is the question as to if Deckard is actually a replicant. In that scenario what is the impact of his feelings for Rachel.

Key issue – was it wrong to enslave the replicants, using them as forced labour given that they were of human-like appearance and had a human-like thought process. What would need to be different to be ok as forced labourers – e.g. would we have the same doubts with mechanised droids with limited thought processes/emotions?

The replicants are androids, produced by advances in bio-engineering. Whilst looking like, and thinking like humans to a point, the replicants have differ in their psychological trains to real humans. One such aspect is their emotional response to stimuli, this makes them dangerous to humans as a result of unforgiving mentality, strength and lack of remorse. Another aspect is the inability of replicants to form memories, this contributes to them being ruthless and lacking empathy.

The Turing Test (called the Voigt-Kampff test in the movie) is employed by Deckard to determine if a subject is human or replicant, asking a series of questions and gauging the emotional responses to them.

As the AI replicants in the film appear to be experiencing pain, negative emotions and a fear of death – we are forced to consider If this is a &quot;being&quot; which should fall under the same ethical code protections afforded to humans.

The replicants clearly have a underdeveloped emotional state, making them very dangerous to humans despite being created by humans. So we have opposing dynamics, the humans perceive the replicants as being objects lacking the ability to learn empathy and to assimilate into society, which clashes with the replicants inability to understand a humans worth. Therefore, as it seems likely that the replicants will not comprehend morality and ethics to the level that human society depends upon, there cannot be a harmonious state.

Blade running makes this especially challenging compared to other AI such as Hal 9000 in 2001 a Space Odyssey, or the interplanetary visitors from It Came From Outrer Space, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E T – The Extra Terrestrial – where these did not have the human form. One key question is how should something that looks human, to all purposes is biologically human, but is made in a lab be treated compared to a &quot;born&quot; human, and especially when the &quot;born&quot; human is has significant cognitive impairments – society norms, ethical codes and laws provide for care and protection for these vulnerable members of society, why not for the replicants?
